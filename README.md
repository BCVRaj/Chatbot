🌐 ChatBot with Web Scrapy and Pre-trained LLMs
🚀 Overview
This project is a ChatBot designed to extract relevant information from websites using Web Scrapy and answer user queries intelligently. The bot leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) from Ollama to process, analyze, and deliver contextually accurate responses to user queries.

By combining web scraping with the power of advanced language models, the chatbot enables efficient and seamless information retrieval, especially for domain-specific tasks such as health and education.

✨ Features
🔎 Web Scraping: Efficiently extracts data from websites using Web Scrapy.
🤖 Intelligent Query Handling: Processes user questions and provides meaningful answers.
📚 Pre-trained LLM Integration: Utilizes Ollama LLMs to enhance the understanding of queries and data.
🌐 Domain-Specific Responses: Specially tuned to provide information related to health and education topics.
⚡ Real-Time Interaction: Engages users in real time, offering prompt and accurate responses.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python: Primary programming language.
Web Scrapy: For extracting data from websites.
Ollama LLMs: Pre-trained language models for query processing and response generation.
Flask/Django (optional): For building the chatbot's web interface (if applicable).

⚙️ Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chatbot-web-scrapy.git
cd chatbot-web-scrapy
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python installed. Then run:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Configure Web Scrapy
Update the web_scraper.py file with the target website URLs and scraping logic.

Integrate Ollama LLMs
Ensure you have access to Ollama LLMs and configure the API keys in the query_processor.py file.

Run the ChatBot

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Interact with the Bot
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:5000 (if Flask/Django is used) or interact via the terminal.

🚨 Limitations
Website scraping is subject to robots.txt restrictions and ethical considerations.
Responses are limited by the scope of the scraped data and the capabilities of the pre-trained LLM.
Internet access is required for web scraping and LLM API integration.
